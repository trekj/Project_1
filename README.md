## What We're Creating
This project is a quantitative analysis of 5 of the 6 ARK ETFs. Our goal is to see how much investment potential these ETFs have based on key risk-management metrics: the daily returns, standard deviations, Sharpe ratios, and betas. We will be working on a Jupyter Notebook and visualizing all of our data using hvplot to create interactive visualizations as well as running an MC Simulation at the end to forecast the returns of these ETFs over the next 30 years. 

## What is an ETF?
An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a type of pooled investment security that operates much like a mutual fund. Typically, ETFs will track a particular index, sector, commodity, or other asset, but unlike mutual funds, ETFs can be purchased or sold on a stock exchange the same way that a regular stock can. An ETF can be structured to track anything from the price of an individual commodity to a large and diverse collection of securities. ETFs can even be structured to track specific investment strategies.

The first ETF was the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), which tracks the S&P 500 Index, and which remains an actively traded ETF today. ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp))

## What are the ARK ETFs?
The ARK ETFs are a set of six exchange traded funds offered by ARK Invest, an investment firm started by Catherine Wood. Each ETF specializes in a certain sector.

ARKK is the Innovation ETF.

ARKQ is the Autonomous Tech. & Robotics ETF.

ARKW is the Next Generation Internet ETF.

ARKG is the Genomic Revolution ETF.

ARKF is the Fintech Innovation ETF.

ARKX is the Space Exploration & Innovation ETF. (This fund is brand new and thus lacks the historical data needed to run an analysis so we left it out.)
